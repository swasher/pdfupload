# Steps to reproduce new server:
# - install fresh ubuntu machine on ESXi (testing on 15.04). During install select `OpenSSH Server`.
# - Write down custom ssh port to /etc/ssh/sshd-config
# - Assign appropriate static IP in winbox for new machine
# - Reboot
# - On machine, when run ansible: ssh-copy-id [user]@[server-ip] -p [server-port]
# - Note: Provision assumes, that pdfupload machine is dedicated server, so python package will install system-wide.
#         This is due high load on file system during pdf processing.


# Steps to create local development environment
# - install pycharm, virtualbox, vagrant with ubuntu/vivid64
# - open project
# - start vagrant box (tools -> vagrant -> up). Environment with all dependencies will install automatically.
# - add string to your hosts file: [vagrant-box-ip] vagrant.tes.pp.ua
# - vault magic word hint: b-0
